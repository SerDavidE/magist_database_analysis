# Eniac's Expansion into the Brazilian Market

## Introduction

Eniac, an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, has been serving customers for over ten years. Founded in Spain, the company has expanded its reach to various neighboring countries, offering a wide catalog of products at competitive prices. With a warmhearted spirit and professional tech support, Eniac values direct contact with its customers. As the company plans for global expansion, it faces the challenge of retaining its unique human-centric approach.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project was to analyze the feasibility of Eniac's expansion into the Brazilian e-commerce market through a potential partnership with Magist, a Brazilian SaaS company offering a centralized order management system. This analysis aims to address two main concerns:
1. Whether Magist is a suitable partner for high-end tech products like Eniac's.
2. The efficiency of Magist's delivery system, especially for tech products.

## Tools Used

- SQL: For data extraction and analysis.
- Tableau: For data visualization and deriving insights.

## Data Source

The dataset was a snapshot provided by Magist, encompassing their order management, sales data, and customer feedback.

## Methodology

The analysis was focused on:
1. Evaluating the growth of tech sellers on Magist's platform.
2. Analyzing the revenue generated from tech products.
3. Assessing Magist's delivery performance, especially for tech products.
4. Comparing the average delivery time of Magist with other online companies in Brazil.
5. Evaluating customer satisfaction through average ratings.

## Results

Key findings include:
1. A consistent increase in tech sellers on Magist's platform, indicating trust in Magist's performance.
2. Tech products constituted 15% of the overall product sales.
3. Over 90% of tech products were delivered on time, showcasing Magist's capability in handling high volumes and ensuring timely delivery.
4. Both tech and non-tech products experienced a decrease in average delivery time since 2017. Remarkably, Magist had an average delivery duration of 12 days, which is significantly better than the national average of 21 days for other online companies in Brazil.
5. The average customer rating was around 4.3, reflecting a high level of customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion

Based on the data, Magist seems to be a promising partner for Eniac's venture into the Brazilian e-commerce market. However, it is recommended to further investigate the performance of high-end tech products and gather more data on product returns before finalizing any decisions.
